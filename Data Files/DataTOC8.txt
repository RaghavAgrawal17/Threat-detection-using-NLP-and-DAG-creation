WWL DATA POINT ANALYSIS	

							
HWM ID: RTXC-01-01
County: Jefferson
Elevation (from 5' contours): 20
Original Debris Line Elev. (from 5' contours): -
Original Flood Inundation Boundary Elev. (from 5' contours): 5
Distance to Original Debris Line (ft): - 
Distance to Original Flood Inundation Boundary (ft): 9,400
Action: Designated as a WWL Data Point NUAR.
Explanation: Photo shows wrack line, but flagger form indicates "no flooding or damage to building." It does not make sense to extend the inundation polygon to this point because aerials do not show evidence of flooding to the east of this point and the elevation is much higher than the flood elevation.
